# fallin

## what is fallin
Fallin is a game inspired by Doodle Jump, but with a twist - rather than jumping up, you fall down, whilst avoiding obstacles.

## whats it got
It features a shop system, a save/load system, smooth character movement, a good UI (I think?), powerups, a difficulty system and maybe more but I forgot :skul:

I created this project for Siege Week 8, with a 'fall' theme.
